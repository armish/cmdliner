### Warning
This is a fork of the original Cmdliner package,
with a minor modification that allows the developer to set
the preferred `FMT` through `Term.info`:

```ocaml
let cmd =
    let doc = "My tool is..." in
    let version = "0.0.0" in
    let fmt = `Plain in  (* <--- *)
    let man = [
        `S "Description";
        `P "$(tname) does this and that.";
    ] in
    Term.(const my_tool $ input_file $ output_file),
    Term.(info "my_tool" ~version ~doc ~man ~fmt)
                                          (* ^^^ *)

let () = 
    match Cmdliner.Term.eval cmd with 
    | `Error _ -> exit 1
    | _ -> exit 0
```

Cmdliner — Declarative definition of command line interfaces for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release %%VERSION%%

Cmdliner is a module for the declarative definition of command line
interfaces.

It provides a simple and compositional mechanism to convert command
line arguments to OCaml values and pass them to your functions. The
module automatically handles syntax errors, help messages and UNIX man
page generation. It supports programs with single or multiple commands
and respects most of the [POSIX][1] and [GNU][2] conventions.

Cmdliner is made of a single independent module and distributed under
the BSD3 license.

## Installation

Cmdliner can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install cmdliner

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.


## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][3]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the 
distribution.

## Sample programs

If you installed Cmdliner with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var cmdliner:doc`. These programs define
the command line of some classic programs.

In the distribution sample programs are located in the `test`
directory of the distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind test/tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test`.
